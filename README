1) start web2py
2) start one process per product on their own port (must patch port in db)

   cd applications/trading/modules/
   python matchingserver.py -p 8888 intc

3) start log2db deamon (one per product)

   python web2py.py -S trading -N -M -R applications/trading/modules/log2db.py -A intc
   
rationale, decouples the job of logging to db from the job of logging to file
